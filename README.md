# On Your Way - Carpooling Application

**Date:** 2024-08-01

**By:** Jaber Buhusain

## Description
On Your Way is a carpooling application that allows users to create, browse, and book trips. The application is designed to help users share rides, help drivers to make money, and those who don't have a car get cheaper prices to get to their destination. The platform features a user-friendly interface with a dark theme and consistent design across all pages.
